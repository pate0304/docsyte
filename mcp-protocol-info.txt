The Model Context Protocol is an open standard that enables AI applications to securely connect to external data sources and tools. 

Key Benefits:
- Standardized communication between AI models and external systems
- Secure, permission-based access to data
- Extensible tool and resource system
- Support for real-time data access

MCP Components:
1. Servers: Provide tools and resources (like Docsyte)
2. Clients: AI applications that consume MCP services
3. Transports: Communication layers (stdio, HTTP, WebSocket)

Docsyte implements MCP to provide:
- Documentation search capabilities
- Semantic Q&A functionality  
- Citation tracking and source references
